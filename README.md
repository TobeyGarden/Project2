## The Dataset: 

The data set we are analyzing is from [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-price-outlook) from the US Data gov website. We specifically chose the data set showing the Consumer Price Index for food webetwen 1974 and 2023. We wanted to isolate our focus on the years before and after the COVID-19 pandemic which was a market shock in the economy changing the price of foods in notable ways. 

Our dataset contains 3 fields; the Consumer Price Index for each food item, the year that each Consumer Price Index was record from 1974 - 2023, and the Percent Change between each year. 

## Our Questions and Their Importance:
Introduction: As defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the two largest economic recessions in the US within the past 20 years are the great recession of 2007 - 2009 and the COVID-19 recession of 2020. In order to realize the effects that these recessions have had on consumer's lives, more specifically, on consumer's ability to buy healthy foods, we want to visualize the effects these recessions have had on Consumer Price Index so we can see the severity of these notable events in recent US history. Comparing the Great Recession and COVID Recession to each other will provide insight into how consumer's buying power of food has changed over time and can in turn help consumers today prepare for how prices could change in the future.

**Question 1**: How did the Consumer Price Index change for all foods before and after the 2007 - 2009 US recession compared to the Consumer Price Index before and after the COVID pandemic of 2020?

Why it’s important:
This question helps identify how different types of economic crises—a financial recession versus a global health pandemic—influence overall food prices in the U.S. Analyzing CPI changes around these events can:

Reveal the resilience or volatility of the food sector under economic stress.
Help policymakers and researchers understand whether price inflation in food was more severe or prolonged during one crisis versus another.
Inform future emergency preparedness and response strategies, especially in ensuring food security during large-scale disruptions.
Provide insights into long-term inflation trends and their effects on basic needs like nutrition.

**Question 2:** In comparison to Consumer Price Index changes during the 2007 - 2009 recession, how did the changes in Consumer Price Index during the COVID pandemic effect consumer's buying power of healhty foods, specifically dairy, eggs, fresh fruits, and fresh vegetables?

Why it’s important:
This question narrows in on nutritional affordability, which is crucial for public health. It focuses not just on food in general, but on healthy staples, offering a deeper understanding of:

How economic shocks disproportionately affect access to nutritious foods, which can have long-term consequences on health, particularly among low-income populations.
Whether supply chain disruptions or demand shifts during COVID impacted healthy food prices more severely than during the 2007–2009 recession.
The role of CPI in shaping dietary behavior and health disparities during crises.
How inflation in essential categories (like dairy, fruits, vegetables) might inform nutrition assistance program adjustments, such as SNAP benefits.

## Manipulations To Our Data Set:
We did not need to manipulate the data extensively because the dataset already provided the exact values we needed. The Food Price Outlook dataset included annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) values for all food categories, organized clearly by year. Since the data was already broken down by year and food category, we were able to directly withdraw the relevant values for the periods surrounding the 2007–2009 recession and the COVID-19 pandemic without having to perform complex calculations or adjustments. Minor steps, like filtering specific years, were performed to analyze trends. Overall, the dataset was structured in a way that made it easy to answer the question with minimal additional manipulation.

## Analysis and Results:

Our visualization allows us to see the journey for food prices throughout dramatic economic events in the COVID pandemic and the Great Recession. According to the COVID timeline, the pandemic was declared a national emergency in early 2021 with the eventual peak of the pandemic occurring in January of 2022. This timeline coincides perfectly with the largest rise in food prices in our 2015-2023 visualization. The pandemic then began to decline after early 2022, but we can see that prices never went back to the way they were pre pandemic. 

Now looking at the Great Recession we can see another example of the economic shock having a tremendous effect on prices. The housing crisis bubble burst occurred in late 2007 and the crisis lasted until 2009. In our visualization for the prices during this time, it becomes clear that the Great Recession had an opposite impact on food prices than COVID did. While both events marked hard times for Americans and severe economic instability, when you think about the effects of each event individually the effects make sense. 

COVID sparked a period of isolation and fear of the public in United States citizens. This likely caused everyone to stockpile on food and other essentials to avoid putting themselves at risk to get the virus. This change in consumption pattern combined with a supply chain disruption caused by the inability of employees to work, would explain the dramatic jump in food prices during the peak of the pandemic. The Recession on the other hand marked a different kind of instability in the U.S. The financial crisis greatly reduced the income of American households and took away their purchasing power. With significantly less money to spend, the demand for food went down and prices were forced to meet the new demand. This decrease in demand combined with no effect on supply, unlike COVID, explains the opposite effect on food prices we see between the two major events.

**Question 2 Visualization

Our visualization displays relatively stable prices for healthy food throughout these economic shock events; however, eggs seem to be the odd product out with extremely volatile price changes relative to those of the other products displayed. Dairy products, fresh fruits, and fresh vegetables all remain constant with little price changes throughout the time period, never coming near a 20% change in either direction. On the other hand, egg price changes are all over the place, even during times unrelated to our major events. 

Another important result from the visualization is the consistency with the total food prices we explored in the last question. Similarly to the total food prices, all healthy foods experienced a price decrease to some degree during the great recession, while all of the foods experienced a price increase during COVID. While the price changes are hard to see for the foods displayed other than eggs, they are consistent with our previous findings just to an extremely small and stable degree. This shows that when it comes to healthy foods, most of them are relatively secure and safe from the dramatic price changes caused by these extreme national events. 

The extreme volatility of eggs compared to these other healthy foods is an interesting result and could be caused by several key factors about eggs. First, eggs are one of the cheapest sources of protein, so when COVID causes people to rush to the supermarket and stockpile their groceries in preparation of an at-home heavy lifestyle, eggs were the go to item. Second, egg production is likely the least versatile out of any of these food groups. While the other foods displayed have relative control over the supply, hens lay eggs at a rate according to their biology and there is little that can be done to adjust to the needs of consumers. Overall, healthy foods are more resistant to these events than other foods, but eggs are extremely intolerant of economic instability and consumer spending changes.
