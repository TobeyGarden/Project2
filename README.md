## The Dataset: 

The data set we are analyzing is from [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-price-outlook) from the US Data gov website. We specifically chose the data set showing the Consumer Price Index for food webetwen 1974 and 2023. We wanted to isolate our focus on the years before and after the COVID-19 pandemic which was a market shock in the economy changing the price of foods in notable ways. 

Our dataset contains 3 fields; the Consumer Price Index for each food item, the year that each Consumer Price Index was record from 1974 - 2023, and the Percent Change between each year. 

## Our Questions and Their Importance:

Question 1: How did the Consumer Price Index change for all foods before and after the 2008 US recession compared to the Consumer Price Index before and after the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020?

Question 2: In comparison to Consumer Price Index changes during the 2008 recession, how did the changes in Consumer Price Index during the COVID-19 pandemic effect consumer's buying power of healhty foods, specifically dairy, eggs, fresh fruits, and fresh vegetables?

As defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the two largest economic recessions in the US within the past 20 years are the great recession of 2007 - 2009 and the COVID-19 recession of 2020. In order to realize the effects that these recessions have had on consumer's lives, more specifically, on consumer's ability to buy healthy foods, we want to visualize the effects these recessions have had on Consumer Price Index so we can see the severity of these notable events in US history. Comparing the Great Recession and COVID Recession to each other will provide insight into how consumer's buying power of food has changed over time and can in turn help consumers today prepare for how prices could change in the future.
